This is a little project that I've been working on for a while with the primary goal of gaining a more in depth understanding of deep learning and honing various skills

This is meant to be my version of tensorflow and while its definitely not as good as tensorflow for now, It does have same basic functions.

This project is also a package which can be downloaded through pip (functional now)


Activation functions
  - Leaky Relu ("lrelu")
  - Relu ("relu")
  - Sigmoid ("sigmoid")
  - Softmax ("softmax")

Error Functions
  - Mean Squared Error ("mse")
  - Cross Entropy ("cross_entropy")

Optimization algorithms
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent ("sgd")
  - ADAM ("adam")
  - 

In the future, I hope to add Categorical Cross Entropy, add Reinforcement Learning algorithms, Convolutional Neural Networks and other stuff.
